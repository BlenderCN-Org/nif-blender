Release 2.1.6 (Nov 13, 2010)
============================

* The optimize spell now includes two new spells:
  opt_collisiongeometry for optimizing triangle based collisions, and
  opt_collisionbox for optimizing simple box collisions. This should
  result in faster loads and probably also a small but noticable
  performance improvement.

* Fixed opt_collisiongeometry for multimaterial mopps (reported by
  wildcard_25, see issue #3058096).

* New SpellCleanFarNif spell (suggested by wildcard_25, see issue

  of processors is used---requires Python 2.6 or higher (suggested by
  chaky2, see issue #3052715, implements issue #3065503).

* New opt_delzeroscale spell to delete branches with zero scale
  (suggested by chaky2, see issue #3013004).

  rlibiez), it is included in the optimize spell.

* New opt_collisionbox spell which automatically converts triangle
  based box collisions to primitive box collisions, which are much
  faster in-game (contributed by PacificMorrowind).

* Optimizer spell now uses triangles to represent skin partitions
  (improves in-game fps).

* Better vertex map calculation when calculating skin partitions
  (improves in-game fps).

* Optimizer now always triangulates (improves in-game fps).
  Stripification will be readded later in a modularized version of the
  optimizer spell, for those that want minimal file size rather than
  maximal performance).

* Much faster implementation of vertex cache algorithm (now runs in
  linear time instead of quadratic time).

* Check triangle count when converting to box shape (fixes issue
  #3091150).

* Bugfix in vertex map reordering (fixes most nifs reported in issue
  #3071616).

* Bugfix in vertex cache algorithm (fixes a nif reported in issue
  #3071616).

  (fixes a nif reported in issue #3071616).

* Remove branches if they have no triangles (again fixes a nif
  reported in issue #3071616).

Release 2.1.5 (Jul 18, 2010)
============================

* Improved interface for TRI files, and a bugfix in TRI file writing.

* Added EGT file support.

* The fix_texturepath spell now also converts double backslash in
  single backslash (suggested by Baphometal).

  by norocelmiau, issue #2996800).

* Added support for Laxe Lore nifs (reported by bobsobol, issue
  #2995866).

* New spells:

  - opt_collisiongeometry: to optimize collision geometry in nifs
    (contributed by PacificMorrowind).

  - check_materialemissivevalue: checks (and warns) about high values
    in material emissive settings (contributed by PacificMorrowind).

  - modify_mirroranimation: mirrors an animation (specifically left to
    right and vice versa) - use it to for example turn a right hand
    punch anim into a left hand punch anim (contributed by
    PacificMorrowind).

* Added big-endian support.

* Removed ``**kwargs`` argument passing for faster and more transparant
  implementation (reading and writing is now about 8% faster).

* Do not merge BSShaderProperty blocks (reported by Chaky, niftools issue
  #3009832).

* Installer now recognizes Maya 2011.

* Fixed NiPSysData read and write for Fallout 3 (reported by Chaky,
  niftools issue #3010861).

  (this fixes some nifs mentioned in issue #2795837 by baphometal).

* Skip zero weights and add up weights of duplicated bones when
  calculating vertex weights (this fixes some nifs mentioned in issue
  #2795837 by baphometal).

* The nif optimizer can now handle NiTriShapeData attached as a
  NiTriStrips data block (fixes some corrupt nifs provided by
  baphometal in issue #2795837).

* Optimizer can now recover from NaN values in geometry (sample nifs
  provided by baphometal).

* Do not attempt to optimize nifs with an insane amount of triangles,

  track of it between releases (see issues #2787602 and #2795837
  reported by alexkapi12 and xfrancis147).

* Removed parenting in xml model from everywhere except Array, and
  using weakrefs to avoid circular references, which helps with

  variants, and can install itself into every Maya version that is found.

* Updates to the XML object model (affects CGF, DDS, KFM, NIF, and TGA).

  - Class customizers are taken immediately from the format class, and not
    from separate modules --- all code from customization modules has been
    moved into the main format classes. The result is that parsing is faster
    by about 50 percent.

  - clsFilePath removed, as it is no longer used.

* Updates and fixes for the KFM format.

  - The Data element inherits from Header, and Header includes also all
    animations, so it is more straightforward to edit files.

  - The KFM files open again in QSkope.

  - Removed deprecated scripts (niftexdump, nifdump, ffvt3rskinpartition,
    nifoptimize).

  - Fixed scaling bug on nifs whose tree has duplicate nodes. Scaling now no
    longer works recursively, unless you use the scaling spell which handles
    the duplication correctly.

* Updated module names to follow pep8 naming conventions: all modules have
  lower case names.

Release 1.2.4 (Apr 21, 2009)
============================

* Documentation is being converted to Sphinx. Currently some parts of the
  documentation are slightly broken with epydoc. Hopefully the migration will
  be complete in a month or so, resolving this issue.

* removed deprecated PyFFI.Spells code:

  - old style spells no longer supported

  - almost all old spells have been converted to the new spell system
    (the few remaining ones will be ported for the next release)

* nif:

  - nif optimizer can be run on folders from the windows context menu
    (right-click on any folder containing nifs and select "Optimize with PyFFI")

  - synced nif.xml with upstream (adds support for Worldshift, bug fixes)

  - using weak references for Ptr type (this aids garbage collection)

  - added fix_strip niftoaster spell which can remove branches selectively
    (feature request #2164309)

  - new getTangentSpace function for NiTriBasedGeom (works for both Oblivion
    and Fallout 3 style tangent spaces)

  - improved mergeSkeletonRoots function (will also merge roots of skins that
    have no bones in common, this helps a lot with Morrowind imports)

  - new sendDetachedGeometriesToNodePosition function and spell (helps a lot
    with Morrowind imports)

* tga:

  - added support for color map and image data in the xml

  - uses the new data model

  - works again in QSkope

* xml object model:

  - added support for multiplication and division operators in expressions

===========================

* removed reduce() calls (py3k compatibility)

* started converting print calls (py3k compatibility)

* removed relative imports (py3k compatibility)

* removed BSDiff module (not useful, very slow, use external bsdiff instead)

* nif:

  - fixed the update mopp spell for fallout 3 nifs

  - fixed addShape in bhkPackedNiTriStripsShape for fallout 3 nifs

  - niftoaster sends to stdout instead of stderr so output can be captured
    (reported by razorwing)

Release 1.2.2 (Feb 15, 2009)
============================

* cgf format:

  - fixed various regression bugs that prevented qskope to run on cgf files

  - updated to use the new data system

Release 1.2.1 (Feb 2, 2009)
===========================

* nif format:

  - new addIntegerExtraData function for NiObjectNET

Release 1.2.0 (Jan 25, 2009)
============================

* installer directs to Python 2.5.4 if not installed

* using logging module for log messages

* nif format:

  - swapping tangents and binormals in xml; renaming binormals to bitangents
    (see http://www.terathon.com/code/tangent.html)

  - updates for Fallout 3 format

  - updated skin partition algorithm to work for Fallout 3

    + new triangles argument

    + new facemap argument to pre-define partitions (they will be split further
      if needed to meet constraints)

    + sort vertex weight list by weight in skin partitions (except if padbones
      is true; then sorted by bone index, to keep compatibility with ffvt3r)

    + option to maximize bone sharing

  - mopps take material indices into account and compute welding info
    (attempt to fix mopp multi-material issues, does not yet seem to work though)

  - support for niftools bitflags by converting it to a bitstruct on the fly

  - better algorithm for sending bones to bind position, including spells for
    automating this function over a large number of nifs

  - disable fast inverse in bind pos functions to increase numerical precision

  - new algorithm to sync geometry bind poses, along with spell (this fixes
    many issues with Morrowind imports and a few issues with Fallout 3 imports)

  - more doctests for various functions

  - a few more matrix functions (supNorm, substraction)

* dds format:

  - updated to use the FileFormat.Data method (old inconvenient method removed)

* qskope:

  - refactored the tree model

  - all parenting functions are delegated to seperate DetailTree and GlobalTree
    classes

  - the DetailNode and GlobalNode classes only implement the minimal
    functions to calculate the hierarchy, but no longer host the more
    advanced hierarchy functions and data (this will save memory and
    speed up regular use of pyffi outside qskope)

  - EdgeFilter for generic edge type filtering; this is now a
    parameter for every method that needs to list child nodes

Release 1.1.0 (Nov 18, 2008)
============================

* nif format:

  - a large number of functions have moved from the optimizer spell to

    without having to import this spell module
    (getInterchangeableTriShape, getInterchangeableTriStrips,
    isInterchangeable)

  - new convenience functions in NiObjectNET, NiAVObject, and NiNode
    (setExtraDatas, setProperties, setEffects, setChildren, etc.)

  - updates for Fallout 3

* niftoaster

  - new fix_addtangentspace spell to add missing tangent space blocks

  - new fix_deltangentspace spell to remove tangent space blocks

  - new opt_mergeduplicates spell

  - new opt_geometry spell

  - the optimize spell is now simply implemented as a combination of other
    spells

* new internal implementation of bsdiff algorithm

* removed cry dae filter (an improved version of this filter is now
  bundled with ColladaCGF)

* reorganization of file format description code

  - all generic format description specific code has been moved to the
    PyFFI.ObjectModels.FileFormat module

  - all xml/xsd description specific code has been moved to the
    PyFFI.ObjectModels.XML/XSD.FileFormat modules

  - new NifFormat.Data class which now implements all the nif file read and
    write functions

* completely revamped spell system, which makes it much easier to customize
  spells, and also enables more efficient implementations (thanks to tazpn for
  some useful suggestions, see issue #2122196)

  - toaster can call multiple spells at once

  - toaster takes spell classes instead of modules

  - for backwards compatibility, there is a class factory which turns any old
    spell module into a new spell class (the Toaster class will automatically
    convert any modules that it finds in its list of spells, so you do not need
    to be worried about call the factory explicitly)

  - early inspection of the header is possible, to avoid having to read all of
    the file if no blocks of interest are present

  - possibility to prevent the spell to cast itself on particular branches
    (mostly useful to speed up the spell casting process)

  - spells have callbacks for global initialization and finalization of
    data within the toaster

  - possibility to write output to a log file instead of to sys.stdout

  - better messaging system (auto indentation, list nif tree as spell runs)

  - support for spell hierarchies and spell grouping, in parallel or in series
    or any combination of these

* replaced ad hoc class customization with partial classes (still wip
  converting all the classes)

* xml object model expression parser

  - implemented not operator

  - expressions can combine multiple operators (only use this if the result
    is independent of the order in which these operators are applied)

  - new < and > operators

  - support for vercond attribute for Fallout 3

* started on a new object model based on an ANTLR parser of a grammar aimed at
  file format descriptions; this parser will eventually yield a more streamlined,
  more optimized, and more customizable version of the current xml object model
  (this is not yet bundled with the release, initial code is on svn)

Release 1.0.5 (Sep 27, 2008)
============================

* niftoaster

  - new spell to disable parallax (issue #2121283)

* toaster

  - new options --diff and --patch to create and apply patches; interal
    patcher uses bsdiff format, but you can also specify an arbitrary
    external diff/patch command via --diff-cmd and --patch-cmd options
    (the external command must take three arguments: oldfile, newfile,
    and patchfile); note that this is still in experimental stage, not ready
    for production use yet

Release 1.0.4 (Sep 18, 2008)
============================

    shared with geometry data (fixes issue #2065018, MiddleWolfRug01.NIF)

  - fix in case merged properties had controllers (issue #2106668)

* fix writing of block order: bhkConstraint entities now always preceed the
  constraint block (this also fixes the "falling sign" issue with the niftoaster
  optimize spell, issue #2068090)

Release 1.0.2 (Sep 15, 2008)
============================

* "negative mass" fix in inertia calculation

Release 1.0.1 (Sep 12, 2008)
============================

* small fix in uninstaller (didn't remove crydaefilter script)

* crydaefilter converts %20 back into spaces (as rc doesn't recognize %20)

* bugfixes for niftoaster optimize spell (pyffi issue #2065018)

Release 1.0.0 (Jul 24, 2008)

  - fixes init_from image paths

  - adds phong and lamber shader sid's

  - enforces material instance symbol to coincide with target

  - sets material names in correct format for material library and
    physicalization

* started on support for collada format, by parsing the collada xsd schema
  description (this is still far from functional, but an initial parser is
  already included with the library, although it does not yet create any
  classes yet)

* fully optimal mopp generation for Oblivion (using the NifTools mopper.exe
  which is a command line utility that calls the mopp functions in the havok
  library, credit for writing the original wrapper goes to tazpn)

* minor updates to the nif.xml format description

* refactoring: library reorganized and some interfaces have been
  unified, also a lot of code duplication has been reduced; see
  README.TXT for more details on how to migrate from 0.x.x to 1.x.x

  - main format classes PyFFI.XXX have been moved to PyFFI.Formats.XXX

  - "XxxFormat.getVersion(cls, stream)" now always returns two
    integers, version and user_version

  - "XxxFormat.read(self, stream, version, user_version, ...)" for all
    formats

  - "XxxFormat.write(self, stream, version, user_version, \*readresult, ...)"
    for all formats

  - in particular, CGF format game argument removed from read and
    write functions, but there are new CgfFormat.getGame and
    CgfFormat.getGameVersion functions to convert between (version,
    user_version) and game

  - also for the CGF format, take care that getVersion no longer
    returns the file type. It is returned with the CgfFormat.read
    function, however there is a new CgfFormat.getFileType function, if
    you need to know the file type but you don't want to parse the whole
    file

  - all XxxFormat classes derive from XmlFileFormat base class

  - common nameAttribute, walk, and walkFile functions

  - XxxTester modules have been moved to PyFFI.Spells.XXX, along with a much
    improved PyFFI.Spells module for toasters with loads of new options

  wrong during write, so - in theory - it should no longer leave you with 
  corrupt nifs; still it is recommended to keep your backups around just in case
