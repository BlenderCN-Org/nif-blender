Special thanks go in particular to:

- Guido van Rossum, and with him many others, for Python, and in particular
  for having metaclasses in Python: metaclasses make PyFFI's implementation
  very easy.

- m4444x for nifskope, which has been an inspiration for PyFFI's xml based
  design, and of course also an inspiration for QSkope.

- wz for his support, and for testing of the library, when the first
  version was being written.

- seith for design of the windows installer artwork.

- Crytek for releasing the Far Cry SDK and Crysis SDK, which contains much
  information about the cgf file format. This has saved many months of hard
  work.

- Crytek and Bethesda for the great games they make.

- Havok, for releasing their SDK without which custom mopp generation would
  not have been possible.

- Karl Norby and Michael Summers for pyxsd, which forms the basis of
  the xsd object model, used for instance to support Collada.
